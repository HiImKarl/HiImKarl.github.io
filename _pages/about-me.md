As an undergraduate student that (somewhat regretably) is not taking computer science, but that wants to work in tech, I decided that learning from well known books like CLRS is probably my best bet. I've started to notice, however, that even if I know the material, I don't really _know_ them, as in I cannot actually sit them and code them up.

Therefore, I have decided to go through CLRS and begin actually _programming_ the algorithms, as well as write about my experiences so that I may help beginners experiencing the same thing.
